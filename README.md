## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this challenge I gained a meaningful experience in working on CSS Grid. All this time I worked with Flexbox and found it very useful. CSS Grid is an important addition to my front end skills. I will definitely start using it on my projects from now on.



### Continued development

I still feel lack of front-end confidence. Even though I have done multiple types of pages. Maybe I am too much of a perfectionist. I think I need to work on javascript programming and do other projects and challenges which include front-end design as well as programming. So I will keep training my front-end layout and programming skills together.
